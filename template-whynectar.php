So if you&rsquo;re wondering why those ridiculously expensive skin products aren&rsquo;t working like they used to, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s because of the ever-dwindling supply of collagen in your body. </p>

					<h2>The more collagen we lose, the older we look!</h2>
					<p>University studies indicate that women over 40 have about half the collagen they enjoyed in their early 20s. And here&rsquo;s the bummer: The body is depending on collagen to keep our skin looking smooth, radiant and free of wrinkles. Unless our collagen is constantly being replenished, the aging process is allowed to run amok at varying speeds. Certainly, environmental factors play a role, such as UV damage, pollution, diet, sleep, stress and facial expressions. But the truth is that we&rsquo;re all destined to run low on collagen unless we start doing something about it right now!

                    <p>As we age, the body loses collagen like air escaping from a balloon. As that balloon continues to deflate, telltale fine lines and wrinkles emerge.

				    <h3>Collagen is dependent on NAD &mdash; and so are we!</h3>
					<p>Here's a little background on NAD, and why researchers are so excited about its incredible anti-aging potential. For starters, NAD is a coenzyme that powers our cells to efficiently burn fats, carbohydrates, sugars and proteins into abundant energy. And it plays a huge role in keeping our skin youthful looking by stimulating the body to manufacture its own collagen. The bad news is that almost immediately after we&rsquo;re born, NAD levels begin dropping &mdash; about 50% for every 20 years of life! If you're 40, you have already lost up to 50% of your NAD level. At that pace, you&rsquo;ll lose another 50% by age 60! </p>
				</div>
				<div class = "b-nad_graf">
					<p>NAD+ decreases approximately 50% every 20 years of life</p>
					<img src = "/wp-content/themes/nectar7-pgb-child/images/nad_graf.png" alt = ""/>
				</div>
				<div class = "b-nad_depend">
					<p>This chart is very bad news for our cells &mdash; especially if you want to look, feel and perform like you&rsquo;re years younger! Here&rsquo;s why: NAD is known as the communications molecule between the nucleus and the mitochondria. When we&rsquo;re young, our cells are humming along beautifully, NAD levels are HIGH and communication levels are off the charts. When the nucleus (the cell&rsquo;s quarterback) needs more energy from the mitochondria (the cell&rsquo;s powerhouse), the request is instantly fulfilled.</p><br/>
					<p>However, as we age, NAD levels DECLINE leading to worsening cellular communication and dysfunctional cellular replication. The lower your NAD levels, the steeper the decline in communication, which can ultimately lead to aging, illness and disease.   </p>

			    <h2>Here&rsquo;s why NAD may impact more than just the collagen in your skin!</h2>
			    <p>A research team administered a NAD+ booster to 2-year-old mice over seven days. At the end of the week, they examined the animals' biochemical markers (muscle health) to see if there were any measurable differences. To their astonishment, they noted that those 2-year-old mice now boasted the cell attributes of vibrant 6-month-old mice!</p>
			    <div class="b-doctor_blue ">
			        <ul>
			            <li>Gave 2-year-old mice an NAD+ booster for just 1 week </li>
			            <li>Made the cells resemble those of 6-MONTH-old mice when evaluated for muscle health</li>
			            <li>In humans, 60-year-old mitochondria would become the equivalent of a 20-year-old&rsquo;s</li>
			        </ul>
			    </div>
			    <p>In human terms, that&rsquo;s the equivalent of a 60-year-old having the mitochondria of a 20-year-old just a week later! The research team had succeeded in turning back the biological clock, or as explained in more technical terms, &quot;The NAD+ enabled the nucleus to re-establish communication to the mitochondria and the mice went back to being young again.&quot; </p>
			    <p>The triumph proved that NAD+ levels could be boosted. And as we&rsquo;ve already learned, more NAD+ equals more collagen! Can you imagine what that could mean for your skin?</p>
			    <p>As we&rsquo;ve shared, there are stacks and stacks of university research and science that support key benefits and ingredients in NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen. But how will you know NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen is actually working? </p>

                    <p>&quot;I got to the point where I hated looking in the mirror to put on my makeup,&quot; she recalled. &quot;I felt like all of those expensive collagen skin creams I&rsquo;d been buying for years had been a giant waste of money.&quot;  </p><br/>
                    <p>When she reached 45, she felt as though she was losing the battle against aging big time. </p><br/>
                    <p>&quot;I was desperate, so I starting getting those free department store makeovers, and buying all of the products the stylist recommended. I spent a fortune,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I thought about getting collagen injections, but I found out that collagen basically gets absorbed by the body, so I&rsquo;d have to repeat the process several times a year. As a single mom with two kids in private school, no way that was going to happen.&quot;</p><br/>
                    <p>And as for cosmetic surgery? &quot;I just didn&rsquo;t have an extra five or six thousand dollars laying around for a high-end face-lift from a great doctor,&quot; she said. &quot;Also, I was a little scared that something could go wrong like you see in those TV shows about botched cosmetic surgeries. I finally decided that I was OK with how I looked now &mdash; I just didn&rsquo;t want to look any older.</p><br/>
                    <p>&quot;That&rsquo;s when a friend told me about this new laboratory study conducted by a top doctor. The study proved that this doc was able to make cells young again! Not only that, the very same ingredient he used is also known to stimulate the growth of collagen in the body. How cool is that? And it turns out I could actually buy the product with the same key ingredient he used &mdash; Niagen.  </p><br/>
                    <p> &quot;I&rsquo;ve been using NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen for maybe a month, and I can&rsquo;t believe the difference. It took a couple of weeks to &lsquo;kick in,&rsquo; and now I can see fine lines basically vanishing and my skin smoothing out. OK, at 47, I&rsquo;m not getting &quot;carded&quot; anymore, but I feel so much better about myself. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m not going to stop taking NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen."</p><br/>

					<h2>Is your face worth $50.00 a month? You&rsquo;ll think so every time you look in the mirror!

					<p>

How to use NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen? It&rsquo;s simple. Just take it once a day as you would a vitamin, and then let NECTAR7&rsquo;s Niagen do the rest. As you're taking NECTAR7&rsquo;s Niagen for more youthful-looking skin, you&rsquo;ll also want to take NECTAR7&rsquo;s Niagen for more energy and mental acuity.
					</p>
					<p>Remember that study that noted a 30% increase in NAD with just one dose of Niagen? Well, imagine how much collagen-dependent NAD your body could produce with higher dosages and what that might mean for your skin?
					</p>

					<h3>For the first time!					</h3>

					<p>
						NECTAR7&rsquo;s Niagen & Collagen brings together THREE amazing ingredients in ONE skin restorative product!
					</p>
					<h3>How it works:					</h3>

					<p>
NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen was designed to help restore your body&rsquo;s collagen starting at the cellular level &mdash; something creams and lotions simply CANNOT do. And you already know what boosting your body&rsquo;s supply of youthful collagen can mean for your skin.
					</p>
					<h3>For medical practitioners:			</h3>
                    <p>
NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen is a scientifically based, synergistic blend of three astonishing ingredients formulated to transform your skin. Briefly, here&rsquo;s how it works: While Niagen is busy kick starting your body to synthesize its own natural collagen, the highest potency, marine-based collagen was formulated into NECTAR7 Niagen&reg; & Collagen to help give your body&rsquo;s existing collagen levels a boost. Complementing this three-prong attack against fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin is Hyaluronic acid &mdash; a robust lubricant for the joints and the collagen itself.</p>
					<h3>Formulated to outperform all collagen-only products:			</h3>
                    <p>When you take a close look at these three ingredients, it&rsquo;s easy to see why people expect NECTAR7&rsquo;s Niagen+ to outperform any collagen-only product on the market. </p>
